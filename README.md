# Circumstellar Homework
Hello if you are reading this in 2017 congrats, you are part of my group and/or follow me for some weird reason.
Otherwise, cool! This was a project done in 2017 to figure out the distribution of angular momentum for a class (don't cheat with this).
## Installation
The python file was compiled on python 2.7.14 with the following libraries
* mechanize (TODO: switch to better spider, possibly upgrade to python3)
* matplotlib
* BeautifulSoup
* lxml
* numpy
* argparse (why?)
* Maybe others I haven't caught?
## Code Documentation?
My code is self-documenting, like everything else.
## Mathematica?
Contained are mathematica files I used in this project, one was for string manipulation, and the other I used to double check my work and do a lot of the heavy algorithm creation
